**Project Overview:**

Made In Hundred approached Firework Web Design with a clear vision for their website’s design but needed technical assistance to bring it to life. Our role was to take their initial design and ideas and set everything up, offering suggestions along the way. The final website was built on **Squarespace**, giving the client the flexibility to update both the content and design as their business evolves.

**Key Features:**

- **Custom Setup on Squarespace:**  
  The platform was chosen for its user-friendly interface, allowing the client to easily manage updates without needing technical expertise.

- **Editable Content and Design:**  
  To meet the client’s needs for full control, we set up the website so that they could edit both the content and design. This included sections for their **team members**, **clients**, and **services**, which they can update as needed.

- **Custom Email Setup:**  
  In addition to the website, we helped Made In Hundred set up custom emails for their team, further professionalizing their online presence.

The new Squarespace website has empowered Made In Hundred to take full control of their digital presence. With the ability to update content and design independently, the client now has a dynamic platform to showcase their team, services, and clients. The addition of custom emails for their team members has enhanced internal and external communications, providing a seamless experience for clients and partners alike.
