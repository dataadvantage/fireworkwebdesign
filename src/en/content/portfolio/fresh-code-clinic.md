**Project Overview:**

Firework Web Design partnered with Fresh Code Clinic to create a custom-designed website that showcases the clinic’s beauty services, promotions, and customer reviews. Built on **WordPress**, the site is both visually appealing and easy for the client to manage through a custom Content Management System (CMS). The website supports four languages: Thai, English, Mandarin, and Arabic, expanding the clinic’s reach to a broader audience.

**Key Features:**

- **Custom Web Design:**  
  We designed a fully custom WordPress theme for Fresh Code Clinic, ensuring each page aligns with the brand’s identity. From the homepage to the service pages and customer reviews, every aspect was tailored to create a cohesive and polished user experience.

- **Graphic Design & Copywriting:**  
  Our team provided graphic design services to create visually engaging elements for the website.

- **Multilingual Support:**  
  To help Fresh Code Clinic connect with a wider audience, we integrated language support for Thai, English, Mandarin, and Arabic. This allows users from different backgrounds to browse the website in their preferred language, enhancing accessibility and customer engagement.

- **CMS Integration:**  
  Using WordPress as the platform, we built an easy-to-use CMS, allowing Fresh Code Clinic to update services, promotions, and customer reviews independently. The flexibility of WordPress gives the client full control without needing technical expertise.

With the launch of the new website, Fresh Code Clinic has significantly expanded its reach to international customers who prefer browsing in their own language. The custom WordPress CMS enables the client to keep content fresh and up-to-date, helping them highlight new promotions and services quickly and efficiently. The multilingual functionality has also contributed to an increase in traffic from non-Thai-speaking customers, helping Fresh Code Clinic grow its customer base.
