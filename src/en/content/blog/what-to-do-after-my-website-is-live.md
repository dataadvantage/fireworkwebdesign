# What to Do After Your Website Goes Live (To Get Real Results)

Your website is now live, but it is far from “done.” Think of your website as a **business tool**, not a brochure. Here’s how to make the most out of it and turn it into something that actually delivers results.



## 1. Announce It Everywhere

Let people know your new website exists.

- Share it on social media (more than once)
- Add the link to your email signature
- Update your Google Business Profile
- Tell existing clients and partners
- Add it to invoices, proposals, and presentations

**Goal:** Get initial traffic and visibility quickly.



## 2. Track What Visitors Are Doing

A website becomes valuable when you understand how people use it.

- Review visitor numbers regularly
- See which pages get the most attention
- Monitor form submissions or inquiries
- Identify where visitors leave the site

**Goal:** Make decisions based on real data, not assumptions.



## 3. Focus on Lead Generation (Not Just Traffic)

Traffic alone doesn’t grow a business.

- Make contact forms easy to find
- Use clear calls-to-action (Contact, Book, Get a Quote)
- Offer something valuable (free consultation, estimate, guide)
- Respond to inquiries quickly

**Goal:** Turn visitors into potential customers.



## 4. Keep Content Up to Date

An outdated website quietly loses trust.

- Update services, pricing, or offers when they change
- Add new content such as blog posts or case studies
- Refresh images or examples when needed
- Highlight recent projects or testimonials

**Goal:** Build credibility and encourage repeat visits.



## 5. Improve Based on Real Feedback

Your first version is just the starting point.

- Ask customers how they found your website
- Take note of common questions and answer them on the site
- Improve pages with high traffic but low inquiries
- Simplify language if users seem confused

**Goal:** Make the website clearer and more effective over time.



## 6. Strengthen SEO Gradually

Good search visibility doesn’t happen overnight.

- Focus on one main service per page
- Use clear, customer-friendly language
- Add location details if your business is local
- Publish helpful, relevant content consistently

**Goal:** Grow organic traffic month by month.



## 7. Use the Website in Sales and Marketing

Your website should support real conversations.

- Share specific pages during sales calls
- Send links instead of long explanations
- Use it to prepare clients before meetings
- Connect it to ads or marketing campaigns

**Goal:** Save time and close deals faster.



## 8. Maintain and Protect It

A neglected website quickly loses value.

- Keep software and plugins updated
- Back up the website regularly
- Review performance at least once a month
- Fix small issues before they become bigger problems

**Goal:** Protect your investment and avoid downtime.



## 9. Set 30–60–90 Day Goals

Websites perform best with clear, short-term goals.

**First 30 days**
- Monitor traffic and inquiries
- Fix early issues

**Next 60 days**
- Improve top-performing pages
- Add or refine content

**By 90 days**
- Evaluate results
- Plan SEO, content, or marketing improvements



## Final Mindset Shift

A successful website is:
- Not “launch and forget”
- Not just about design
- Not finished on day one

It’s a **living business asset** that improves with use, feedback, and care.

Treat it that way, and it will continue to deliver value long after launch.
